SubdomainRequirement
====================

Subdomain keyed accounts can be generated by account_location or
subdomain_fu.

Requirements and situations vary, but in my case I needed to
ensure that certain controllers were not available except in
specified subdomains.

Requirements
============
This plugin has dependencies on the plugins/gems I'm using in
the project that I'm extracting this out of.  If need be I'll
make the code more generic to not require these dependencies.

subdomain_fu - needs access to current_subdomain


Example
