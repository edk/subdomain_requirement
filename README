SubdomainRequirement
====================
account_location or subdomain_fu can help implement subdomain
keyed accounts.  However, I needed to ensure access to certain
controllers were not available except from authorized subdomains.

i.e. keep standard accounts from accessing the subdomain
admininstration controllers.


Requirements
============
This plugin has dependencies on the plugins/gems I'm using in
the project that I'm extracting this out of.  If need be I'll
make the code more generic to not require these dependencies.

subdomain_fu - needs access to current_subdomain


Install
=======
script/plugin install http://github.com/edk/git@github.com:edk/subdomain_requirement.git


Usage
=======
In your controller include SubdomainRequirement:

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include SubdomainRequirement
  [...]
end

Putting it in your ApplicationController gives access to all controllers
in your system.

To specify a restricted controller:

class Admin::AccountsController < ApplicationController
  require_subdomain :admin
end

Currently there are no options for require_subdomain.  But as soon
as I come across a need to modify the requirement it can be easily
added.




Comments, questions welcome.  This is my first publicly released plugin so
anything I'm doing which isn't kosher, let me know.
